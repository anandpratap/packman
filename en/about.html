PACKMAN is another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">package manager</a> written in Ruby, which is learned from <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> on Mac OS X, but it crosses platforms (mutiple Linux distributions, Mac OS X, etc.) so that user can install packages with joy by using one command interface. It also offers users the following benefits:
<ul>
  <li>No root privilege is needed, so packages can be installed anywhere.</li>
  <li>Install packages with different compiler sets. Different versions can coexist, and can be switched easily.</li>
  <li>Easy setup of a mirror to serve local offline computers.</li>
</ul>
